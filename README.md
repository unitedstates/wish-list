A wish list for this organization

* A list of all federal agencies with their names, URLs, and logos. Possibly organized with parent child relationships and information about which branch of government they're in. The [/agencies API](http://registry.usa.gov/agencies) from [GSA's social media registry](http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/social-media-registry.shtml#API_Methods) is a start.
